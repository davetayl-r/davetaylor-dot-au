# Hi, I'm Dave

I'm an Economist, sometime Bikepacker, occasional photographer and Khachapuri fan. 

I'm a Research Fellow and PhD Candidate in the Department of Social Work at Monash University where I work with a talented and dedicated team creating and synthesising high-quality evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of complex interventions in social welfare.
