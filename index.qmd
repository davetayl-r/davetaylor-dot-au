# Hi, I'm Dave

I'm a Research Fellow with the [Data Matters](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/spahc/socialwork/datamatters) group at Monash University. 

My applied research seeks to help policymakers make better, evidence-informed decisions in social welfare and human services. Applying causal inference and meta-analytic methods, I'm interested in generating and synthesising evidence on the effectiveness, implementation, and economic impact of complex interventions that aim to improve human capital outcomes for vulnerable children and families.
