# Hi, I'm Dave

I'm a Research Fellow and PhD Candidate with the [Data Matters](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/spahc/socialwork/datamatters) group at Monash University. I work on a range of projects that aim to help policymakers make evidence-informed decisions. This involves creating and synthesising high-quality evidence on the effectiveness, implementation and economic impact of complex interventions in social welfare and human services. I focus on applying causal inference methods to generate evidence and (increasingly, Bayesian) meta-analytic methods, to synthesise it.
