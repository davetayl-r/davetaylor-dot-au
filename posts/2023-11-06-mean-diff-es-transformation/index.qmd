I'm in the midst of doing a systematic review of housing and support services interventions for homeless youth.

My go-to effect size calculator is the *`esc`* package.

### Assumptions and Background

1.  **Mean Difference**: You've provided the mean difference between the treatment and comparison groups, which is 23.39.
2.  **Confidence Interval**: The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is ($$10.28, 36.5$$).
3.  **Sample Sizes**: The sample size for the treatment group is ( n_1 = 87 ) and for the comparison group is ( n_2 = 69 ).
4.  **Pooled Standard Deviation**: This is generally calculated from the raw data, but since we don't have that, we'll need to estimate it.

The formula for Cohen's *d* is:

$$
d = \frac{{\text{{Mean}}_1 - \text{{Mean}}_2}}{SD_{\text{{pooled}}}}
$$

### Estimating Pooled Standard Deviation

Since we don't have the raw data, we need to estimate the pooled standard deviation (SD~pooled~). One way to do this is by using the confidence interval for the mean difference. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is often calculated as:

$$
\text{{Mean difference}} \pm 1.96 \times SE
$$

Where ( SE ) is the standard error of the mean difference. From this, we can rearrange to find ( SE ):

$$
SE = \frac{{\text{{Upper limit}} - \text{{Lower limit}}}}{2 \times 1.96}
$$

The standard error of the mean difference is related to the pooled standard deviation as follows:

$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{{SD_1^2}}{n_1} + \frac{{SD_2^2}}{n_2}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{{SD_{\text{pooled}}^2}}{n_1} + \frac{{SD_{\text{pooled}}^2}}{n_2}} = SD_{\text{pooled}} \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}
$$

From this, we can solve for (SD~pooled~):

$$
{SD_{\text{pooled}}} = \frac{SE}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

Finally, we can plug (SD~pooled~) into the formula for Cohen's *d*.

Let's proceed with the calculations.

The calculated values are as follows:

-   Standard Error (SE) of the mean difference: (\~ 6.69 )
-   Estimated Pooled Standard Deviation (SD~pooled~): (\~ 41.49 )
-   Cohen's *d: \~* 0.564

Based on these calculations, the estimated effect size ( *d* ) is approximately 0.564.

# Introduction

The confidence interval for Cohen's ( d ) can be estimated using the confidence interval for the mean difference and the estimated pooled standard deviation. In this section, we'll go through the steps to calculate this confidence interval.

# Steps to Calculate Confidence Interval for Cohen's ( d )

## Step 1: Calculate the Standard Error of Cohen's ( d )

The standard error of Cohen's ( d ) can be calculated using the standard error of the mean difference, ( SE ), and the estimated pooled standard deviation (SD~pooled~).

$$
SE_d = \frac{SE}{SD_{\text{pooled}}}
$$

## Step 2: Calculate the Confidence Interval for Cohen's ( d )

The confidence interval can then be calculated using this standard error and the Z-value corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., ( Z = 1.96 ) for a 95% confidence level).

$$
\text{CI for } d = d \pm Z \times SE_d
$$

Here, ( d ) is the calculated Cohen's ( d ), ( Z ) is the Z-value for the desired confidence level, and ( SE_d ) is the standard error of Cohen's ( d ).

# Results

The calculated values for the confidence interval of Cohen's d are as follows:

-   Standard Error (( SE_d )) of Cohen's ( d ): (~ 0.161)
-   95% Confidence Interval for Cohen's ( d ): (~ [0.248, 0.880])

Based on these calculations, the estimated effect size ( d ) of approximately 0.564 falls within a 95% confidence interval of approximately (0.248, 0.880), reinforcing that the effect size is likely to be moderate to possibly large.
