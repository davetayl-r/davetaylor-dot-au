# Project summary

## About

This ongoing project supports the development of [Youth Futures Foundation's (YFF) *Youth Employment Toolkit*](https://youthfuturesfoundation.org/toolkit/) by analysing the impact of individual components of active labour market programs (ALMPs) on young people’s employment outcomes in high-income countries. The Toolkit seeks to provide evidence-informed guidance on policy and practice to improve youth employment outcomes — read more about it [here](https://youthfuturesfoundation.org/about-the-youth-employment-toolkit/).

A major challenge in understanding what works in youth employment programs is the complexity of ALMPs, which often include multiple active components. For example, a program targeting young people not in education, employment, or training might combine job search assistance, basic skills training, employment coaching, and off-the-job technical training. Traditional meta-analytic methods typically evaluate these interventions as single, discrete entities, limiting the ability to assess the impact of individual components.

To address this, we employed component network meta-analysis (NMA). This approach allows us to disentangle the effects of individual program components and their combinations, providing Toolkit users with actionable insights into the comparative effectiveness of different approaches — insights that go beyond what can be achieved through standard meta-analyses or regression frameworks.

I began this project when I was at the Centre for Evidence and Implementation and have continued to work on it since moving to Monash University. The project is has been undertaken in stages: 

* **Stage 1 (2021-2023)** — informed the first iteration of YFF's Youth Employment Toolkit. It involved undertaking two rapid evidence assessments, including: 
  * A component network meta-analysis (NMA) of 'employment and skills programs' — this also formed part of my PhD research.
  * A meta-analysis of wage subsidies on employment and education outcomes for participants. 
* **Stage 2 (2024-current)** — is informing an expanded version of the Toolkit. It involves:
  * Broadening the scope of the NMA to analyse all active components of ALMPs.
  * Expanding the search strategy to include recently published evidence.
  * Exploring additional outcomes relevant to youth employment.

We are interested in expanding the scope and accessibility of our analysis in future stages.
