# Project summary

## About

This systematic review stemmed from my work at the Centre for Evidence and Implementation, where I managed an impact evaluation of a novel program providing additional support to young people transitioning from out-of-home care. This experience sparked a broader investigation into the evidence base for policies and programs for care leavers, ultimately shaping my PhD research.

The project unfolded over several years, beginning with an initial search in 2020 that informed a technical report for What Works for Children's Social Care. We updated the search in 2022 to incorporate recent evidence into the review for publication and to support a related review on mental health services for care leavers.

Our review focused on studies with valid counterfactuals, including both randomised controlled trials and observational studies that used methods plausibly controlling for selection into treatment. This yielded 16 studies examining a range of transition support programs and extended care policies, all but one conducted in the United States.

Our analysis pooled results into 20 small meta-analyses for independent living programs and coaching and support programs. However, we have very low confidence in the certainty of these results. Overall, while some interventions, particularly extended care, showed promise, the existing evidence is insufficient to recommend any included approach.

All materials from this project are openly available, including our protocol, pre-registration, technical reports, and supplementary materials. The GitHub repository contains all analysis code and data.
