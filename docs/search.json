    "text": "This ongoing project supports the development of Youth Futures Foundation’s (YFF) Youth Employment Toolkit by analysing the impact of individual components of active labour market programs (ALMPs) on young people’s employment outcomes in high-income countries. The Toolkit seeks to provide evidence-informed guidance on policy and practice to improve youth employment outcomes — read more about it here.\nA major challenge in understanding what works in youth employment programs is the complexity of ALMPs, which often include multiple active components. For example, a program targeting young people not in education, employment, or training might combine job search assistance, basic skills training, employment coaching, and off-the-job technical training. Traditional meta-analytic methods typically evaluate these interventions as single, discrete entities, limiting the ability to assess the impact of individual components.\nTo address this, we employed component network meta-analysis (NMA). This approach allows us to disentangle the effects of individual program components and their combinations, providing Toolkit users with actionable insights into the comparative effectiveness of different approaches — insights that go beyond what can be achieved through standard meta-analyses or regression frameworks.\nI began this project when I was at the Centre for Evidence and Implementation and have continued to work on it since moving to Monash University. The project is has been undertaken in stages:\n\nStage 1 (2021-2023) — informed the first iteration of YFF’s Youth Employment Toolkit. It involved undertaking two rapid evidence assessments, including:\n\nA component network meta-analysis (NMA) of ‘employment and skills programs’ — this also formed part of my PhD research.\nA meta-analysis of wage subsidies on employment and education outcomes for participants.\n\nStage 2 (2024-current) — is informing an expanded version of the Toolkit. It involves:\n\nBroadening the scope of the NMA to analyse all active components of ALMPs.\nExpanding the search strategy to include recently published evidence.\nExploring additional outcomes relevant to youth employment.\n\n\nWe are interested in expanding the scope and accessibility of our analysis in future stages.\n\n\n\nThis project is funded by the Youth Futures Foundation.\n\n\n\nThis project is a collaboration between researchers from Monash University, the Centre for Evidence and Implementation, the Institute for Employment Studies and the HEDCO Institute for Evidence-based Educational Practice at the Univeristy of Oregon."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project was a commissioned evaluation of a pilot accommodation and support service for care leavers in New South Wales. The Premier’s Youth Initiative (PYI) was designed to reduce homelessness among young people transitioning from out-of-home care by combining personalised advice, education and employment mentoring, transitional accommodation, and long-term housing support.\nWe conducted a hybrid type-1 implementation–effectiveness study using linked administrative data from child welfare and homelessness services. Propensity-score methods were used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated on ten measures of homelessness between ages 18 and 19. To understand implementation, we held focus groups with young people, service providers, and the funder to explore how the program was received and to identify barriers and facilitators to delivery.\nThis was a multi-year project, with findings released at different stages. The initial evaluation ran from 2017 to 2020 and was published as a technical report. I later extended the analysis using updated data and a revised analytic framework as part of my PhD, with results published in a peer reviewed article. For this updated analysis, I developed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) through a structured Delphi process involving researchers, practitioners, and policy stakeholders to map the data-generating process and guide the identification strategy.\nOverall, PYI did not produce measurable effects on any of the homelessness outcomes—estimated impacts were consistently close to zero. Subgroup analyses suggested that Aboriginal participants experienced poorer outcomes than their non-Aboriginal peers, while young people who had experienced homelessness during care may have benefited more from PYI, though findings were inconsistent. Implementation findings showed high acceptability among participants but pointed to substantial barriers, particularly around planning and support for leaving care.\nAll published materials from this project are available, including the journal article, technical reports, and supplementary materials. The GitHub repository contains the full analysis code.\n\n\n\nThis project was commissioned and funded by the NSW Department of Communities and Justice.\n\n\n\nThis evaluation was a collaboration between researchers from the Centre for Evidence and Implementation (who employed me at the time), Monash University and the Behavioural Insights Team."
