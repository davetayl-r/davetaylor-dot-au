My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I work on a range of projects that aim to help policymakers make evidence-informed decisions. This involves creating and synthesising high-quality evidence on the effectiveness, implementation and economic impact of complex interventions in social welfare and human services. I focus on applying causal inference methods to generate evidence and (increasingly, Bayesian) meta-analytic methods, to synthesise it."
